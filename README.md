## Background

Back in 2015, I had a Galaxy Tab 3 SM-T110 that stored a lot of my memories: photos, videos, and apps like WhatsApp and
Instagram. Over time, it broke down, the battery gave out, and it just wouldn’t turn on anymore.

I managed to bring it back to life and recovered my media files. WhatsApp, however, no longer worked on Android 4.2.2,
so I couldn’t open it. The good news was that the local WhatsApp data was still there, waiting to be recovered.

Curious to see if I could get my old messages back, I ended up figuring it out this way.

## What this does

- Extract WhatsApp encryption keys stored locally on the device.
- Retrieve local WhatsApp message databases for analysis or personal backup.
- Work on non-rooted Android devices without compromising device security.
